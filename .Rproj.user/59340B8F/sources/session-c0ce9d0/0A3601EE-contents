# espanso

This repo contains many of my regularly used shortcuts. In the past I've used AutoHotkey, which is also open source, but  a little more complicated
to get a hang of. Espanso, in my opinion, is a little bit more intuitive and user-friendly. You can find my shortcuts in the `match` directory.
